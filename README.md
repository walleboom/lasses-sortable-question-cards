# LasseÂ´s Sortable Question Cards
Quickstart for my brother to get started with Svelte/SvelteKit (https://svelte.dev/)

## Demo
https://walleboom.se/lasse/

## Required development tools
1. Git (https://git-scm.com/downloads)
2. Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/)
3. NodeJS LTS (https://nodejs.org/en)
4. NPM (comes with NodeJS)

## Getting started
When you've installed the required tools you'll have to copy this repository, open a terminal and copy-paste:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:walleboom/lasses-sortable-question-cards.git
```

In the root directory of the project, run:

```bash
npm install
```

Open the project in Visual Studio Code:
```bash
code .
```

## Developing

Start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.


# Good luck bro'! :)
